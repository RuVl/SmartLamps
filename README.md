# ESP8266 LED Lamp with WS2812B Effects

## Overview

This project is an ESP8266-based smart lamp using a WS2812B addressable LED matrix. The firmware is written in C++ using PlatformIO and the
Arduino framework. The lamp supports multiple dynamic lighting effects, which can be controlled via a sensor button, a web interface, or MQTT
messages.

## Hardware Requirements

- **ESP8266/ESP32** - I use WEMOS d1 mini
